However, acute exercise did not significantly alter emotional response as indexed by fixation duration, number of fixations, longest fixation, or AOI preference. In the model we postulated by which emotional response could mediate the effects of exercise on mood, we would have expected to see participants have significant positive changes in their emotional processing patterns post-exercise compared to pre-condition. This would include increased fixation (both frequency and duration) on positive stimuli and decreased fixation on negative stimuli.

However, this was clearly not due to insufficiency of methods of data collection and analysis. Different emotional content of images also correlated with different scanning patterns and fixation tendencies. This can be seen in participants’ tendency to fixate more frequently on positive images at all times. However, it is especially evident in the analysis of which AOI participants fixated on most frequently for each category of emotional content. Interestingly, the pattern of fixations on the eyes is nearly inverted from negative to positive images—possibly an indicator to part of the differential viewing strategies for positive and negative emotional content. However, averaged across all AOIs, participants spent significantly more time looking at the eyes and mouth for positive and negative images than they did for neutral images, and this did not change post-condition. This indicates that while viewing an image for the same amount of time, participants spent significantly more time gathering salient emotional information from the eyes and mouth for positive and negative images than they did for neutral images.
